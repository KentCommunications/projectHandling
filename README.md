KCI Programming Projects
========================

Before you begin
----------------

If the project you are starting is in fact new, start by creating a repo on github. Otherwise you should initialize a git repo in the existing codebase and add that to github.

New Projects
------------

Go to the [Kent Communications Github page](http://github.com/KentCommunications/) and click on the "New Repository" button to create your repository.      

Existing Projects
-----------------

Open a shell in the root of the project directory and run the following commands:

    > git init     
    > git add .
    > git commit -am "Initial Commit"
